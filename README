==============
 SRPM TOOLSET
==============

Set of tools to obtain all sources to build SRPM (source RPM -> *.src.rpm
file), which then can be built into binary RPM.

This is useful for continuous integration/development purposes -> when you
e.g. want to (a) generate SRPM for each "git push" into repository, and
(b) then try to build RPMs.

Install by 'autoreconf && ./configure && make install', or for now:

  https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/praiskup/srpm-tools/

Motivation:

  SRPM is generated from SPEC [1] file && set of sources (those sources
  are also pointed to by SPEC file).  Such sources are usually "released
  tarballs".  For continuous integration purposes, such upstream released
  tarball either do not exist _yet_ (so those need to be generated from
  git) or at least the tarball is not stored within git repository
  (together with SPEC file) so it needs to be downloaded.  That's where
  this project should help.


srpm-get-sources
----------------

  Download or generate sources from spec file.  This script must be run
  from directory where '.srpmconfig' file and spec file exist.

  If the source file doesn't exist yet, the tool tries to 'wget' it, or
  generate it via git-archive.


srpm-generator
--------------

  Generate source RPM based on spec file and .srpmconfig file.


.srpmconfig semantics (YAML)
----------------------------

    # Find 'NAME.spec' in this directory, and parse it's contents.
    specfile: NAME.spec

    # Handle Source0 tag explicitly.
    source0:
        # Generate tarball via 'git archive' command (whole git project).
        method: git_archive

        # Members within generated tarball will start with 'NAME-VERSION/'
        # path.  This is is optional (the prefix is usually detected from
        # tarball name, e.g. "tar-1.19" for "tar-1.19.tar.gz").
        archive_prefix: NAME-VERSION

        # Additional data for git_archive method, optional.
        git_archive:
            repo:
                # Instead of using the actual git repository, clone this one.
                address: https://git-clone-url.com/project
                # Clone the project into this subdirectory.
                subdir: project

FAQ
---
(Q) Why the .srpmconfig is needed?  Why we don't define those data
    within SPEC file directly?
(A) SPEC files are usually used by "downstreams" (e.g. by
    Fedora/RHEL/SUSE/Mageia/..) to build binary RPMs.  Downstream
    packagers however want to build RPMs from _released_ tarballs -- not from
    generated ones.  Having .srpmconfig file minimizes differences between
    downstream SPEC files and the one used for CI purposes.
